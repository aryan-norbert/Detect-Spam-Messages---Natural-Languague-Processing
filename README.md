# Detect Spam Messages - Natural Language Processing

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`Spam Message detection.ipynb`) that implements a machine learning model for detecting spam messages using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

## Overview

The `Spam Message detection.ipynb` notebook showcases:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Text cleaning and preprocessing techniques.
- **Feature Extraction**: Utilizing TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) for feature extraction.
- **Model Building**: Training a supervised learning model (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM) to classify messages.
- **Evaluation**: Metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate model performance.

## Files

- `Spam Message detection.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the complete code and explanation.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview of the project and instructions.

## Usage
